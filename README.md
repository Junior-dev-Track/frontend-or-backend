# Frontend Or Backend

This challenges has two objectives, the first one, would be a funky way for you to tell me if you are going to focus on frontend or on backend :)

The second one would be also a way for you to train on how to create a branch. (amazing)

The challenge is the following, clone this repo, create a branch where you will add your name to the following list, don't forget to also mention frontend or backend

## The list:

- Snoop Dioggy Diogue -> Frackend
- Argjent -> Frontend
- LÃ­lia : Frontend
- Arianne -> backend
- Yordie -> Backend
- Yavanna > Frontend
- Joao Silva -> Backend please.
- Innessa -> backend
