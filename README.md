# Frontend Or Backend

This challenges has two objectives, the first one, would be a funky way for you to tell me if you are going to focus on frontend or on backend :)

The second one would be also a way for you to train on how to create a branch. (amazing)

The challenge is the following, clone this repo, create a branch where you will add your name to the following list, don't forget to also mention frontend or backend

## The list:

- Snoop Dioggy Diogue -> Frackend
<<<<<<< HEAD
-  BITARINSA ARTHUR   FRONTEND
=======
- Myriam Kadi -> Backend
>>>>>>> c0c4f044b4de2ae221b4e18e3896bd8448cef82e
